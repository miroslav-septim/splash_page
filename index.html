            <h2>Baldurs Gate III</h2>
            <h4>Baldur's Gate III is a role-playing video game that looks to offer both a single-player and cooperative multiplayer element. Players will be able to create one or more characters and form a party along with computer-generated characters to explore the game's story. Optionally, players will be able to take one of their characters and team up online with other players to form a party.[3] It was announced during the PAX East 2020 event that, unlike the previous Baldur's Gate games, Baldur's Gate III combat would be turn-based, similar to Larian's earlier games Divinity: Original Sin and Divinity: Original Sin II.
                In the late 15th century DR, almost a century after the events of Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn, the forces of darkness are on the rise. The player character has been taken captive by the mind flayers, who have launched an invasion of Faerûn, and implanted with an illithid tadpole, a parasite capable of enthralling and transforming them into another mind flayer. Before the mind flayers can transform their victims, the nautiloid flying ship they are all aboard comes under attack from githyanki warriors and flees through multiple realms, including Avernus, the first of the Nine Hells. The player character is freed during the fighting and steers the damaged ship back to Faerûn, where it crashes. As the player character searches for a way to remove their parasite, they encounter other survivors of the wreck: the human wizard Gale, the half-elf cleric Shadowheart, the high elf vampire Astarion, the human warlock Wyll, and the githyanki fighter Lae'zel.[5]
